# Habits Project
> Excellence is a Habit -- Aristotle

I attempt to take advantage of the polysemy behind the word `commit`, to have a version controlled list of habits that I seek to acquire. Each day, I will attempt to add a small goal, or resize an existing one. Each week, I will attempt to remove a bad habit. 

Humor: if expected time to acquire a habit is 2 months, and excellence is a habit, excellence here I come =D
