# Novelty Project
I attempt to take advantage of the polysemy behind the word `commit`, to have a version controlled list of habits that I seek to acquire. Each day, I will attempt to add a small goal, or resize an existing one. Each week, I will attempt to remove a bad habit. 

## Suggestions for tomorrow
### Choose one to add to habits or dailies.
* tweak: stretches after meal as first break segment
* recall three grateful things before sleep
* recall three funny things before sleep 
* make arithmetic practice spaced repped, ie hard ones get shown more frequently
* use redder setting for f.lux
* limit light exposure 30 mins before sleep

## Dailies
### Aesthetics
* Read, ponder, and clearly enunciate two poems
* Journal for 10 mins a day: self-expression

## Habits
### Health
* Alternate between 12 pushups / crunches / 1 min plank planks every ~20 mins, using workrave for timing
   + take three deep breaths

* rinse after each meal / snack

### Spaced Repetition
* 5 mins Arithmetic Practice

## Bad Habits
### Nicknames, as no one wants to list bad habits
* Frictors

### Dead baddies
