# Novelty Project
I attempt to take advantage of the polysemy behind the word `commit`, to have a version controlled list of habits that I seek to acquire. Each day, I will attempt to add a small goal, or resize an existing one.

## Suggestions for tomorrow
### Choose one to add to habits or dailies.
* tweak: stretches after meal as first break segment
* 5 mins Arithmetic Practice

## Dailies
### Aesthetics
* Read, ponder, and clearly enunciate two poems
* Journal for 10 mins a day: self-expression

## Habits
### Health
* Alternate between 12 pushups / crunches / 1 min plank planks every ~20 mins, using workrave for timing
   + take three deep breaths
