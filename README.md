# Novelty Project
I attempt to take advantage of the polysemy behind the word `commit`, to have a version controlled list of habits that I seek to acquire. Each day, I will attempt to add a small goal, or resize an existing one.

## Suggestions for tomorrow
### Choose one to add to habits or dailies.
* Alternate between 12 pushups / crunches every ~20 mins, considering using workrave for timing.

## Dailies
### Aesthetics
* Read, ponder, and clearly enunciate two poems

## Habits

## MOOCs
### Current
#### Try for one section a day for each course.
* [Introduction to UI Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui-design/home/welcome)
* [Paradigms of Computer Programming: Fundamentals](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LouvainX+Louv1.1x+3T2016/info)
* [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics/home/welcome)

### Completed
#### Ideally, useful courses should be space-rep't while learning.
* [Machine Learning Intro](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
* [Introduction to Recommender Systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems/home/welcome)

### Space-rep'd
#### Takes more time to learn, but keep the wisdom for a lifetime.
